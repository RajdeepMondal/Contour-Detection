# Contour-Detection
This is an implementation of the contour detection algorithm proposed in the paper Topological Structural Analysis of Digitized Binary Images by Border Following by Suzuki and Abe 1985.
The function raster_scan() requires a zero-padded binary input image.
The outputs are the contour coordinates and hierarchy of the contours. The images are assumed to be four-connected.
